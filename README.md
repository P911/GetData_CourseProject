GetData\_CourseProject
=====================

Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data

In the repository, you'll find the programming
assignment for the coursera course Getting
and Cleanding Data.

The main part of this repository is the
file run\_analysis.R with the R script
to read data files and clean the data
to produce a "tidy" data frame.
Furthermore, the script produces a second
data set with aggregated measures.

The script assumes that the data files
can be found in the working directory.

A description of the producted data frames
can be found in the file CodeBook.md.
